Question: How can i implement this login algorithm in nodejs?

username
The user's account name.

NOTE: usernames are limited to 20 characters and have no character restriction.

salt
salt is a cryptographically random 32-byte value.

verifier
verifier is derived from salt, as well as the user's username (all uppercase) and their password (all uppercase).

To obtain the verifier you need to calculate:

Calculate h1 = SHA1("USERNAME:PASSWORD"), substituting the user's username and password converted to uppercase.

Calculate h2 = SHA1(salt || h1), where || is concatenation (the . operator in PHP).

NOTE: Both salt and h1 are binary, not hexadecimal strings!

Treat h2 as an integer in little-endian order (the first byte is the least significant).

Calculate (g ^ h2) % N.

NOTE: g and N are parameters, which are fixed in the WoW implementation.

g = 7

N = 0x894B645E89E1535BBDAD5B8B290650530801B18EBFBF5E8FAB3C82872A3E9BB7

Convert the result back to a byte array in little-endian order.
